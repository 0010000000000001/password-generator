## Installation
- _Use the command `git clone https://github.com/0010000000000001/password-generator.git` to download to the selected directory._
- _The script requires libraries, use the command `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`_
- _To run the script, use the command `python passw.py`_
 
_Or just download `.rar` from the [link](https://github.com/0010000000000001/password-generator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)_


## Download and run .exe
_Although I do not recommend this method because sometimes `Windows Defender` falsely reacts to a .exe file compiled through the `pyinstaller` library_

- But, for a quick start of the program you can download just an .exe file or the folder with the library via [Releases](https://github.com/0010000000000001/password-generator/releases)
